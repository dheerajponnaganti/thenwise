# Changelog

## 0.1.2

- Plan history: every version of planning-with-files plans (`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`, at the project root or in `.planning/<slug>/`) is kept, masked, before Claude changes it. The background sync also saves plans edited by hand. Each version is a dated `plan` record that search, asof and trace find. `ingest.plans: false` turns it off. Paused and excluded projects are skipped, and `forget <project folder>` removes the project's plans.
- README: opens with the three questions Thenwise is built for (why, what was tried, what held on a date) and the go/no-go result.

## 0.1.1

- Masking: a key wrapped at a line break, a key glued to `_` or `-`, and Twilio `SK` keys are now masked. Mask version 4: the archive masks old copies again on the next sync.
- Teams preview: waiting shares retry in the background sync at session start. A lock keeps two processes from losing a queued change.
- Teams preview: `thenwise team remove <name>` asks whether to keep or delete the member's shared notes (`--keep-notes`, `--delete-notes`). Without a terminal it needs one of the flags.
- The sync lock no longer fails when it is released mid-read, and a fresh lock is never taken as stale.

## 0.1.0

First release. Teams mode is a preview. Windows is experimental.

- Claude Code plugin: an MCP server with seven tools (`memory_search`, `memory_current`, `memory_why`, `memory_tried`, `memory_asof`, `memory_trace`, `memory_read`), a skill that says when to use each, and slash commands for status, resume, off and on.
- Hooks: a background sync at session start, a resume brief after compaction, a short file history when Claude reads a file. Hooks exit fast and never fail the chat. Errors go to a log file.
- Local archive of past chats with secrets masked, and a SQLite graph of chats, compaction summaries, commits and PRs. Updates are incremental and match a full rebuild.
- PRs through `gh` when it is signed in. Read only, cached for a day.
- `thenwise setup`: choose projects, vault place, notes folders, PRs and backup. `thenwise doctor` checks the install.
- Curated notes vault (`_thenwise/`): decisions, dead ends, timeline and file histories, with a format version. Your own notes are read and never rewritten.
- Projects can be excluded or paused. Chats with an exclude marker are never archived.
- Teams preview: a small self-hosted server where members share chosen notes. Raw chats never leave the machine.
- Formats: config version 1, store format 1, vault format 1. A newer format is refused with a message.
- Needs Node 22.16 or later.
- Apache 2.0.
