# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release. Teams mode is a preview. Windows is experimental.

- Claude Code plugin: an MCP server with seven tools (`memory_search`, `memory_current`, `memory_why`, `memory_tried`, `memory_asof`, `memory_trace`, `memory_read`), a skill that says when to use each, and slash commands for status, resume, off and on.
- Hooks: a background sync at session start, a resume brief after compaction, a short file history when Claude reads a file. Hooks exit fast and never fail the chat. Errors go to a log file.
- Local archive of past chats with secrets masked, and a SQLite graph of chats, compaction summaries, commits and PRs. Updates are incremental and match a full rebuild.
- PRs through `gh` when it is signed in. Read only, cached for a day.
- `thenwise setup`: choose projects, vault place, notes folders, PRs and backup. `thenwise doctor` checks the install.
- Curated notes vault (`_thenwise/`): decisions, dead ends, timeline and file histories, with a format version. Your own notes are read and never rewritten.
- Projects can be excluded or paused. Chats with an exclude marker are never archived.
- Teams preview: a small self-hosted server where members share chosen notes. Raw chats never leave the machine.
- Formats: config version 1, store format 1, vault format 1. A newer format is refused with a message.
- Needs Node 22.16 or later.
- Apache 2.0.
